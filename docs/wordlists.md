# Wordlists

A word about [diceware](diceware.md) wordlists.

A diceware wordlist is a collection of words that are used in the diceware
passphrase generation method. The diceware method is a simple and effective way
to generate strong, memorable passwords or passphrases using dice or other
random number generators. Each word in the wordlist is assigned a unique
numerical code, typically a five-digit number, which allows users to generate
random passphrases by rolling dice.

The format of a diceware wordlist is straightforward. Each line in the wordlist
contains a five-digit number followed by a space and a corresponding word. For
example:

```text
11111 word1
11112 word2
11113 word3
...
```

For the purposes of `diceware4k`, the original wordlists used are available in 
[wordlists](wordlists/readme.md)

The numbers are generated by rolling five dice and converting the results into a
five-digit number. The wordlist can contain hundreds or thousands of unique
words, each with its own associated code.

There are several freely available diceware wordlists that offer different
features. Here are a few examples:

1. _Diceware Wordlist_: The original diceware wordlist created by Arnold G. Reinhold, 
   the inventor of the diceware method. It consists of 7,776 words, each chosen for
   its simplicity and ease of remembering. The list includes a mix of common and
   less common words, providing a good balance between security and
   memorability.
2. _EFF Long Wordlist_: The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) maintains a
   diceware wordlist called the "EFF Long Wordlist." It contains 7,776 words,
   just like the original diceware list, but with a focus on maintaining a high
   level of security. The words in this list tend to be longer and less common,
   which can make passphrases more resistant to dictionary-based attacks. This
   is the default wordlist used by `diceware4k`.
3. _Beale Wordlist_: The Beale Word List, also known as the Beale Cipher, is a
   historic diceware wordlist associated with the Beale ciphers. It consists of
   3,141 words and was allegedly used to encrypt a treasure location. While it
   has a smaller word count compared to other wordlists, it still provides a
   viable option for generating secure passphrases.
4. _EFF Short Wordlist_: The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) maintains a
   diceware wordlist called the "EFF Short Wordlist." It contains 1,296 words
   that have unique three-character prefixes. This means that software could
   auto-complete and/or auto-correct words in the passphrase after the user has
   typed the first three characters. The list is indexed by four digits instead
   of the usual five. This is the default wordlist used by `diceware4k`.
5. _EFF General Short Wordlist_: This wordlist is a shorter version of the original
   diceware list, consisting of 1,296 words. It offers a more concise selection
   of words, which can be useful if you prefer a smaller pool of options for
   generating passphrases.

When choosing a diceware wordlist, it is important to consider factors such as
the size of the wordlist, the complexity of the words, and the balance between
security and memorability. A larger wordlist provides a greater number of
possible passphrases, while a smaller wordlist may be easier to remember. The
choice ultimately depends on your specific needs and preferences.

It's worth noting that additional wordlists may be available online, provided by
various organizations or individuals. However, it is crucial to verify the
trustworthiness and security of these sources before using their wordlists to
generate passphrases.

In conclusion, diceware wordlists are collections of words used in the diceware
passphrase generation method. They follow a numerical code format and offer a
range of options in terms of word count, complexity, and security. Choosing the
right wordlist depends on finding a balance between security and memorability
that suits your specific requirements.

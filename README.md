# passphraser4k

A library for working with [diceware passphrases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diceware). 

Weak passwords and passphrases are one of the most common flaws in computer
security. The Diceware method offers a better way to create a strong, yet easy
to remember, passphrase for use with encryption and security programs. This 
library provides an implementation of the Diceware method of passphrase 
generation, and it uses Java Secure Random to ensure dice rolls are random 
enough. Read more about the Diceware method [here](docs/diceware.md).
